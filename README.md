# HoneyOS

A wasm-based WebOS parodying old lesser-known operating systems such as BeOS

## Building

HoneyOS uses trunk as a bundler:

```bash
trunk build             # Build a distributable version of HoneyOS
trunk serve             # Start a local webserver and host HoneyOS
trunk server --watch .  # Start a local webserver and host HoneyOS with hot-reloading enabled
```
